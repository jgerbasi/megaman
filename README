Week 1 Ideas:

The Javascript Canvas:

The entire game is drawn and played on a canvas. Mega man, all projectiles, and enemies are drawn with sprite-based animations. Keypresses are watched using event listeners for user input, and the game's main engine functionality is called periodically with setInterval.

Object-oriented design is used in almost all aspects of the game, as functions are called to check collisions between mega man, platforms, projectiles, and enemies. 

Our code is broken up into psuedo-modules using the idea of javascript closures. This allowed us to create namespaces for the different objects and separated the code into modular pieces for easier development and debugging. The closures also allowed us to store environmental variables within the 'modules' that could be shared between files.
